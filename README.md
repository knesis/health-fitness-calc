## Health and Fitness Calculator

This MATLAB project takes measurements from the user concerning age, gender, height, weight, and other fitness-related measurements. 

Using this data, the program calculates a person's body fat percentage, body mass index, basal metabolic rate, and total daily energy expenditure.

Comparing a person's caloric intake to their suggested intake (TDEE), the program suggests food and exercise recommendations to approach a target body fat percentage. Exercise recommendations are dependent on user's current diet and fitness regimen.

Exercise and food data scraped from USDA databases and manually preprocessed.

Time-data file includes toy values to demonstrate graphing functionality.

Developed in Matlab, 2015.
